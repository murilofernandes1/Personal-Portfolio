      <p className="about">Hey! I’m Murilo, 19 years old, and I’ve been coding since 2023. From backend with C#, to frontend with React and JavaScript, and mobile apps with Expo and TypeScript—I’ve built solid skills across the stack. But what really drives me is creating apps that stand out. I’m not interested in building more of the same. I love experimenting, thinking outside the box, and bringing fresh ideas to life.</p>
